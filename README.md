- ðŸ‘‹ Hi
- My namr is Okanlawon Victor
- My future ambition is to become a renowned Cloud Engineer and to develop the largest Cloud Consulting firm in Africa
-I am done with Secondary school
-In the next Five years, by the grace of God, I would have completed higher institution, I would have also started processing my Masters degree at a university in USA or Canada
I joined ICTG for quite a lot of reasons, but amongst various reasons I chose ICT among other service groups, was because I was looking for a serive group that was in line with my career, and to also get to connect with professional in the tech industry who are believers so that I could learn from them
I have gained a lot since I joined ICT, ranging from the knowledge I get in classes, to the connections and opportunities that I have been able to secure overtime
